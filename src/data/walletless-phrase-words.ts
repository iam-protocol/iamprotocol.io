/**
 * Curated subset of the validator's word dictionary for the WALLETLESS
 * verification preview (master-list #94 follow-up, 2026-04-26).
 *
 * Walletless mode is cosmetic — it doesn't go through `/validate-features`,
 * so the displayed phrase isn't bound to anything server-side. The only
 * reason this list exists is style parity with the wallet-connected flow:
 * since #89 v3 the wallet flow shows real curated words ("trading duty
 * assembly wins command"), so showing nonsense syllables in walletless is
 * jarring for casual researchers comparing the two modes.
 *
 * Source: each word is verified to exist in
 * `executor-node/src/challenge/word_dict.rs` (which is a verbatim copy of
 * `entros-validation/src/word_dict.rs`). The full dict has 1,357 entries;
 * this 80-word subset gives 80^5 ≈ 3.3 billion phrase combinations —
 * astronomically more than enough for cosmetic non-repetition. Keeping the
 * subset small avoids bloating the client bundle and avoids the drift-
 * detection cost that would come with shipping the full dict client-side.
 *
 * Words selected for: short (4-6 letters), unambiguous, neutral or
 * positive valence, alphabetically distributed across the dict for
 * variety.
