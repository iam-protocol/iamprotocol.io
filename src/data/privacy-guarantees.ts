      "Raw audio, motion, and touch data are never persisted after the Temporal Fingerprint is computed. No server-side database holds voice samples or movement traces. Your encrypted fingerprint is cached locally for fast re-verification and held on chain in a wallet-keyed AES-256-GCM blob—recoverable from any device by the wallet that wrote it, opaque to everyone else. The blob holds only a one-way hash of the behavioral summary plus a random salt; raw audio, motion, and touch are never inside it.",
